= ripltools

This is a meta gem which installs some useful {ripl}[https://github.com/cldwalker/ripl] plugins for a nice-to-use, general purpose _ripl_.

== Setup

  gem install ripltools
  
== Usage
To use it, put the following in your <tt>~/.riplrc</tt> file (this file is loaded every time you start _ripl_):

  require 'ripltools'

If it does not exist, just create a new one.

You cannot modify the loaded plugins. If you want to change them, copy the source of this gem and paste it in your <tt>.riplrc</tt>.

Alternatively, you can use ripltools to easily install the plugins, but require manually the ones you want.

=== Irbtools
The {irbtools}[https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools] gem is compatible with _ripl_ and _ripltools_. _ripltools_ only includes _ripl_-specific gems, while _irbtools_ includes general "Ruby console features" (e.g. {interactive_editor}[https://github.com/jberkel/interactive_editor]).
